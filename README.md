## Welcome to WordFinder Repository

The objective of this program is to create a Class that searches the matrix to look for the words from the word stream. Words may appear horizontally, from left to right, or vertically, from top to bottom.

This solution has three projects:

 - *Wordfinder*: Contains interfaces and implementation (Classes) of the WordFinder challenge.
 - *Datastructures*: Contains the data structure implementation (Trie) to resolve efficiently this problem.
 - *UnitTests*: Has some unit tests used to check basic functionality.

**Trie Implementation:**
For this exercise was used a Prefix Tree data structure (Trie) that offers a highly efficient way to store and retrieve words. Each letter of the word is stored in the tree and it is easy to insert and find words, and avoid unused space.
